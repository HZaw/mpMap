\title{Impute unknown recombination fraction values}
\usage{
mpimputerf(mpcross)
}
\arguments{
\item{mpcross}{Object of class \code{mpcross}}
}
\value{
The original object with any NA values of rf$theta replaced by imputed values
}
\description{
Construct a new mpcross object, with missing recombination fraction values imputed.
}
\details{
Imputation is performed by replacing missing values with a value from the `nearest' column. Here the distance between two columns of the recombination fraction matrix is determined by treating both columns as points in euclidean space and taking the euclidean distance between these points. In theory using rows instead of columns may result in a different imputed value, but in practice the difference between the two approaches is probably negligible.
