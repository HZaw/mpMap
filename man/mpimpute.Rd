\title{Impute missing values for an mpcross object}
\usage{
mpimpute(object, what = c("both", "founders", "finals"), threshold = 0.5,
  calls = c("discrete", "continuous"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{mpcross}}

\item{what}{Whether to impute founders, finals, or both}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for probability to call an allele}

\item{calls}{Form of the finals output - discrete (genotype calls if above the threshold), or continuous (expectation of allele). For multiallelic markers no value will be imputed if continuous output is selected.}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters to be passed into mpprob function}
}
\value{
An mpcross object with a new component $missfinals and $missfounders for the original set of genotypes. The components $finals and $founders replaced by the imputed values.
}
\description{
Use multi-point founder probabilities to fill in the most likely value for a missing genotype
