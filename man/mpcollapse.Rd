\title{Collapse an mpcross object into a binned object}
\usage{
mpcollapse(object, method = c("rf", "cor"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{Object of class \code{mpcross}}

  \item{method}{Choice of whether to bin based on
  recombination fraction or correlation}
}
\value{
A binned object of class \code{binmpcross}
}
\description{
Collapses an mpcross object into bins. Markers are recoded
as binned markers (BM) where the genotype at a BM is
determined from the haplotypes observed in the founders
within the bin. Information on which markers belong to each
bin is retained within the output object.
}
\note{
Markers are assigned to a bin if there is zero
recombination between any of the markers within the bin (or
correlation of 1). Missing values at markers are imputed
based on the assumption that the true haplotype within a
bin matches one of the founder haplotypes. Patterns
matching more than one or none of the founder haplotypes
will be coded as NA in the returned object. Bins are
collapsed to "bin markers" after missing values are
imputed, with each unique founder haplotype being assigned
an allele and progeny matching those founder haplotypes
assigned the same allele.
