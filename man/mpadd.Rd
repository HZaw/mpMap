\title{Function to combine two data sets which have the same pedigree and genetic lines, but different (potentially overlapping) marker data.}
\usage{
  mpadd(mpcross1, mpcross2, gpu)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mpcross1}{First of the two objects to be combined}

  \item{mpcross2}{Second of the two objects to be combined}

  \item{gpu}{Should a GPU be used to do any required
  recombination fraction calculations, if available.
  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{mpcross}

  If recombination fractions have been calculated for
  either of the input objects, the recombination fractions
  will also be calculated, for all the markers in the final
  object. Similarly, if LD has been calculated for either
  of the input objects, LD will be calculated for all
  markers in the final object. Previous calculations are
  re-used in the process, so this is much more efficient
  than discarding the recombination fraction / LD data from
  both objects and recomputing again.
