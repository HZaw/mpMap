\title{Count how many generations of advanced intercross (AI) are in a pedigree. The number of AI generations can differ for each individual in the pedigree.}
\usage{
nai(pedigree, IDs, nFounders)
}
\arguments{
\item{pedigree}{Pedigree for a multi-parent cross. Can be generated using \code{\link[mpMap]{sim.mpped}}}

\item{IDs}{A numeric vector containing the rows within the pedigree, for which we are interested in the number of AI generations. Defaults to all.}

\item{nFounders}{Number of founders}
}
\value{
A vector of integers, containing the number of generations of advanced intercrossing after mixing stage but before selfing, for each line in the final population
}
\description{
Counts the number of generations of breeding preceding selfing and
subtracts off the number necessary to minimally mix the founders' genomes. The number of founders for the design is extracted from the pedigree, and must be a power of 2.
