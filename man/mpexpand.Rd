\title{Expand a binned object to one containing full marker information}
\usage{
  mpexpand(object, fullmpcross)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{Binned object of class \code{binmpcross}}

  \item{fullmpcross}{Object of class \code{mpcross}
  containing}
}
\value{
  If \code{fullmpcross} is input, this function will return
  an object of class \code{mpcross} where bins have been
  expanded into the full set of markers included in each
  bin. Otherwise this function will return a map object
  where bins have been replaced by the full set of markers
  within a bin, all co-located.
}
\description{
  Given a binned mpcross object, will expand the map to
  include all markers within bins at the same positions. If
  an additional mpcross object is input (containing
  genotype information for all markers), will also reformat
  that object according to the binned order.
